# Ultrasound Signal Processing Notebooks

**Practical, runnable Jupyter notebooks for ultrasound signal processing, simulation, and prototyping.** This repository provides hands‑on examples, synthetic data generators, and helper utilities to explore ultrasound physics, preprocessing, feature extraction, and basic detection and visualization workflows.

---

## Overview

This collection is designed for engineers, researchers, and students who want reproducible, educational examples they can run and adapt. Notebooks are modular so you can run individual steps (signal generation, preprocessing, feature extraction) or the full pipeline end to end.

**Key goals**
- Provide clear, runnable examples for ultrasound workflows  
- Demonstrate preprocessing and feature engineering techniques commonly used in ultrasound analysis  
- Offer simple detection, visualization, and benchmarking demos that are easy to extend
